# Hackathon-ETL
ETL process with IMDB movie and ratings  data in Jupyter Lab for a Hackathon

## Purpose
To gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. Then cleaned a ratings data set and saved that to the same SQL database.

## Summary
The final result created an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
